Real Time Bus Tracker


Welcome to the Real Time Bus Tracker- heading from University of San Francisco to Sausalito! The map will take you on a bus path from USF to the shores of Sausalito.

For this project you will need your own Access Token, which can be created via a Mapbox (or another mapping service of your choice): https://www.mapbox.com/

Future improvements to this project can be smoothing out the animation process, adding some more buttons for useful information, and including more bus stops or alternate routes.

Follow me here on Github or Twitter (@Jill_Crook1) for questions, or to stay updated on future projects.

Happy coding!
