Real Time Bus Tracker


Welcome to the Real Time Bus Tracker- heading from University of San Francisco to Sausalito! The map will take you on a bus path from USF to the shores of Sausalito. By using JavaScript to track the coordinates of the bus stops, and a Map API, we can track this route!

How to Run: For this project you will need your own Access Token, which can be created via a Mapbox (or another mapping service of your choice): https://www.mapbox.com/
Download the files in this repository, and then paste your Token into the JavaScript (I have left a comment where to paste it). Refresh and see the map!

Future Improvements: Future improvements to this project can be smoothing out the animation process, adding some more buttons for useful information, and including more bus stops or alternate routes.
