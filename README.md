Real Time Bus Tracker


Welcome to the Real Time Bus Tracker- heading from University of San Francisco to Sausalito! The map will take you on a bus path from USF to the shores of Sausalito.

For this project you will need your own Access Token, which can be created via a Mapbox (or another mapping service of your choice): https://www.mapbox.com/

Follow me here on Github or Twitter (@Jill_Crook1) for questions, or to stay updated on future projects.

Happy coding!
